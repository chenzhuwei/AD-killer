Advertising is the most perfect terminator ad filter on a Chrome browser. Ad terminator can remove all the web pages of advertising, video ads, malicious popups, tracking code, speed up page loading speed. The size is only 0.2M, but the filtering on more than 99% of the advertising, light enough quantity, reduce the burden on the system.


Common problem

Q: why is there an advertisement after installation?

1. ensure that the web is a fast mode.



2. ensure that the terminator is in the open state (the icon in the address bar is green).



The 3. option is to see if the default filtering rules exist. If it is lost, please add it by hand. Use the latest filtering rules.



4. close other advertising filter plug-ins, 360 and Cheetah users, and pay close attention to the closure of your own advertising interception (very important use help - Notes).



Q: why do Youku, Iqiyi and other videos still have advertisements?

Enable filtering enhancement script (Reference: use help - enable filtering enhancement script).



Q: why not enable filter enhancement scripts or filter some video ads?

The default rule of advertising terminator can not only shield web advertising, but also screen most video advertisements.



Q: why does the rule update fail?

Access: http://sub.adtchrome.com/adt-chinalist-easylist.txt, if it can be opened, update the rules again; if not, check whether the network is connected to normal, still not, please contact us (contact mode)
